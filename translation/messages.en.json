    "monomulti": "In Dofus, there are 2 ways to play the game, both have their + and -, there is not really one better than the other, it comes down to personal preferences.\nMultiaccount means to play with several accounts at the same time connected on the same server (It's different from creating and playing several characters, in this case, you have several Dofus windows open with several accounts created), multiaccount generally allows to create between 2 and 8 accounts in order to manage the content autonomously, multiaccount is the standard on all the servers called multiaccount (which allow it), with the most popular being Echo. The main reasons for playing multiaccount would be to not have to rely on others (play whenever you want, no need to wait in front of a dungeon), to not play with people who will screw up the fight (what determines who wins the fight is only you, not some random person you don't know who didn't know how to play) and to have access to an extremely large panel of spells in order to do lots of synergies. Note that you have to subscribe each account to play multiaccount, but for example buying 4 novice packs (4x4 =16 euros) and playing for 1 month is a fairly possible strategy to start a team and keep subscribing in kamas.\n\nSingle account means to play with only one account at the same time, this is usually the most popular for new players (logical, if you don't know anything about the game you just run it once), by playing single account you are more invested in playing with people, making relationships, friends, having a guild and playing all together. You will also need to use the in-game recruitment channel to recruit for quest fights and dungeons. We can also note that the ergonomics is easier when you play only one account and not several, because in multiaccount you have to manage all the accounts."
